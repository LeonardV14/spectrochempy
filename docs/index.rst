Introduction
============

What is |scpy|?
----------------

|scpy| is a framework for processing, analysing and modelling **Spectro**\ scopic
data for **Chem**\ istry with **Py**\ thon. It is is a cross platform software,
running on Linux, Windows or OS X.

#.  A |NDDataset| object embedding array of data with coordinates and metadata.
#.  A |Project| manager to work on multiple |NDDataset| simultaneoulsly.
#.  `Units`` and ``Uncertainties`` for |NDDataset| and NDDataset coordinates
    |Coord|.
#.  Mathematical operations over |NDDataset| such addition, multiplication
    and many more ...
#.  Import functions to read data from experiments or modelling programs ...
#.  Display functions such as ``plot`` ...
#.  Export functions to ``csv``, ``xls`` ... (NOT YET)
#.  Preprocessing functions such as baseline correction, masking bad data,
    automatic subtraction and many more ...
#.  Exploratory analysis such as ``svd``, ``pca``, ``mcr_als``, ``efa``...
