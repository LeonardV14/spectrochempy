Introduction
============

What is |scp|?
--------------

|scp| is a framework for processing, analysing and modelling **Spectro**\ scopic
data for **Chem**\ istry with **Py**\ thon. It is is a cross platform software,
running on Linux, Windows or OS X.

1.  A |NDDataset| object embedding array of data with coordinates and metadata.
2.  `Units` and `Uncertainties` for |NDDataset| and |NDDataset| coordinates.
3.  Mathematical operations over |NDDataset| such addition, multiplication
    and many more ...
4.  Import functions to read data from experiments or modelling programs ...
5.  Display functions such as ``print``, ``plot`` ...
6.  Export functions to ``csv``, ``xls`` ...
7.  Preprocessing funtions such as baseline correction, automatic subtraction
    and many more ...
8.  Exploratory analysis such as ``svd``, ``pca``, ``mcr_als``, ``efa``...

.. warning::

    |scp| is still experimental and under active development.
    Its current design is subject to major changes, reorganizations,
    bugs and crashes!!!.
