Where are the Preference Files Saved?
=====================================
The main application preference file is saved in a hidden directory called `
.spectrochempy/config` located in your home user directory. In principle you
should not need to access to this file, but if you wants to do it,
you can use one of these solutions :

On Mac OSX system you access to this file by typing in the terminal:

.. sourcecode:: bash

	$ cd ~/.spectrochempy
	$ open spectrochempy.ini

On Linux system, the second command can be replaced by:

.. sourcecode:: bash

	$ vim spectrochempy.ini

or whatever you prefer to read and edit a text file.
