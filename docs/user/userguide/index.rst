User Guide
==========

The |scpy| **API** is accessible in a terminal using a python or
an IPython shell.

However, the recommended way is to use a Jupyter notebook.

Assuming Jupyter is installed (if not install it!), go to the
|scpy| folder. From this location, open a
terminal and type:

.. image:: images/launch_jupyter.png

Your default explorer is now launched.

.. image:: images/jupyter_home.png

You can now navigate to the userguide notebooks in  `docs/user/userguide`.

Click on the the fist notebook : **introduction.ipynb**

.. image:: images/jupyter_intro.png

This notebook and others are used to produce this user guide.
So this way you can follow the explanations given below.
