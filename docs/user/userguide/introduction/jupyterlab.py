# ### Using Jupyter Notebook

# %% [markdown]
# Assuming ``Jupyter`` is installed (*i.e.*, you have followed the [Spectrochempy installation procedure](../../../gettingstarted/install.rst)), go to the
# ``spectrochempy`` folder. From this location, open a
# terminal and type something like:
#
# ![launch](../images/launch_jupyter.png)
#
# Your default explorer is now launched.
#
# ![launched](../images/jupyter_home.png)
#
# You can now navigate to the Tutorial notebooks in [tutorials]  (docs/user/tutorials) or the notebooks used for this user guide.
#
# Click on the the fist notebook : **introduction.ipynb**
