class Svd(HasTraits):
    """Performs a Singular Value Decomposition of a dataset.
    
    The SVD is commonly written as :math:'X = ur \Sigma V^{T}'. This class \
    has the attributes: ur, s = diag(S) and Vt=V.T.
    If the dataset contains NaN values (e.g. if parts of the spectra have\
    been blanked, the corresponding ranges are ignored in the calculation.

    Parameters
    -----------

    X : :class:`~spectrochempy.core.dataset.nddataset.NDDataset` object of
    shape (``N``, ``M``)

    full_matrices : `bool`, optional, default=`False`.

        If `False` , ur and Vt have the shapes\
        (`N`,  `k`) and (`k`, `M`), respectively, where `k` = min(`N`, `M`). \
        Otherwise the shapes will be (`M`, `M`) and (`N`, `N`), respectively.

    compute_uv: `bool`, optiopnal, default=True.

        Whether or not to compute ur and Vt in addition to s.

    Attributes
    ----------

    ur : :class:`~spectrochempy.core.dataset.nddataset.NDDataset`.

        ur contains the left unitary matrix.
        Its shape depends on `full_matrices`.

    s : `numpy.ndarray`. vector of singular values

    Vt : :class:`~spectrochempy.core.dataset.dataset.NDDataset`.

        Vt contains a transpose matrix of the Loadings.
        Its shape depends on `full_matrices`
        :rtype self.ur: Dataset

    Examples
    ---------
    >>> source = NDDataset.load('mydataset.scp')
    >>> svd = Svd(source)
    >>> print(svd.ev)
    [1.18e+04      634 ...,  0.00109 0.000975]
    >>> print(svd.ev_cum)
    [1.18e+04 1.25e+04 ..., 1.25e+04 1.25e+04]
    >>> print(svd.ev_ratio)
    [   0.945   0.0506 ..., 8.69e-08 7.78e-08]
