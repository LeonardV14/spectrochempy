    Functional form of apodization window:

    Where:

    .. math::
        e = pi * x * lb \\\\

    Parameters
    ----------
    lb : float

        Inverse exponential width.
        If it is not a quantity with units,
        it is assumed to be a broadening expressed in Hz.

    gb : float

        Gaussian broadening width.
        If it is not a quantity with units,
        it is assumed to be a broadening expressed in Hz.

    shifted : `float` or `quantity`

        Shift the data time origin by this amount. If it is not a quantity
        it is assumed to be expressed in the data units of the last
        dimension.

    inv : bool, optional

        True for inverse apodization.  False (default) for standard.

    rev : bool, optional.

        True to reverse the apodization before applying it to the data.
