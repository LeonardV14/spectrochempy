    Functional form of apodization window:

    .. math::
        sp(x) = \\sin(\\frac{pi * off + pi * (end - off) * x} {size - 1})^{pow}

    Parameters
    ----------
    off : float

        offset - Specifies the starting point of the sine-bell in time units
        The default value is 0.0.

    end : float

        end - Specifies the ending point of the sine-bell in time units.

    pow : float

        pow - Specifies the exponent of the sine-bell; Non-integer values
        are allowed. Common values are 1.0 (for ordinary sine-bell) and 2.0
        (for squared-bell functions). The default value is 1.0.


    inv : bool, optional

        True for inverse apodization.  False (default) for standard.

    rev : bool, optional.

        True to reverse the apodization before applying it to the data.
