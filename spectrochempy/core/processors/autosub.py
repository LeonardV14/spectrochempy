    Parameters
    -----------
    source : :class:`~spectrochempy.core.dataset.nddataset.NDDataset`.
        Dataset to which we want to subtract the reference data

    ref : :class:`~spectrochempy.core.dataset.nddataset.NDDataset`.
         1D reference data, with a size maching the axis to subtract
         (axis parameter) #TODO : optionally use title of axis

    xrange : pair(s) of values. Any number of pairs is allowed.
        Axis range(s) in which the variance is minimized

    inplace : `bool`, optional, default = False.
        True if the subtraction is done in place.
        In this case we do not need to catch the function output

    axis : `int` [optional, default = -1].
        Tells on which axis to perform the subtraction

    Returns
