    Parameters
    ----------
    larmor: Quantity or float
        The Larmor frequency of the current nucleus.
        If it is not a quantity it is assumed to be given i MHz


    Examples
    --------

    First we set the NMR context,

    >>> set_nmr_context(104.3 * U_.MHz)

    then, we can use the context as follow:

    >>> fhz = 10000 * U_.Hz
    >>> with U_.context('nmr'):
    ...    fppm = fhz.to('ppm')
    >>> print("{:~.3f}".format(fppm))
    95.877 ppm

    or in the opposite direction

    >>> with U_.context('nmr'):
    ...    fhz = fppm.to('kHz')
    >>> print("{:~.3f}".format(fhz))
    10.000 kHz

    Now we update the context:

    >>> with U_.context('nmr', larmor=100. * U_.MHz):
    ...    fppm = fhz.to('ppm')
    >>> print("{:~.3f}".format(fppm))
    100.000 ppm

    >>> set_nmr_context(75 * U_.MHz)
    >>> fhz = 10000 * U_.Hz
    >>> with U_.context('nmr'):
    ...    fppm = fhz.to('ppm')
    >>> print("{:~.3f}".format(fppm))
    133.333 ppm
