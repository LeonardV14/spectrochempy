## What is SpectroChemPy?


SpectroChemPy is a framework for processing, analysing and modelling 
**Spectroscopic**
data for **Chemistry** with **Python**. 

It is is a cross platform software,
running on Linux, Windows or OSX.

  1.  A **NDDataset** object embedding spectroscopic data and metadata.
  2.  `Units` and `Uncertainties` can be specified for |NDDataset|.
  3.  Mathematical operations over |NDDataset| such addition, multiplication 
  and many more ...
  4.  Import functions to read data from experiments or modelling programs ...
  5.  Display functions such as ``print``, :meth:`plot` ...
  6.  Export functions to `csv`, `xls` ...
  7.  Processing funtions such as baseline correction, automatic 
  subtraction and many more ...
  8.  Exploratory analysis such as ``svd``, ``pca``, ``efa``...


### Warning

	SpectroChemPy is still experimental and under active development.
	Its current design is subject to major changes, reorganizations, bugs and crashes!!!.
