What is |scp|?
--------------

|scp| is a framework for processing, analysing and modelling **Spectro**\ scopic
data for **Chem**\ istry with **Py**\ thon. It is is a cross platform software,
running on Linux, Windows or OS X.

  1.  A ``NDDataset`` object embedding array of data with labeled axes and metadata.
  2. ``Units`` and ``Uncertainties`` for ``NDDataset``.
  3.  Mathematical operations over ``NDDataset`` such addition, multiplication and many more ...
  4.  Import functions to read data from experiments or modelling programs ...
  5.  Display functions such as ``print``, ``plot`` ...
  6.  Export functions to ``csv``, ``xls`` ...
  7.  Preprocessing funtions such as baseline correction, automatic subtraction and many more ...
  8.  Exploratory analysis such as ``svd``, ``pca``, ``mcr_als``, ``efa``...

.. warning::

	|scp| is still experimental and under active development.
	Its current design is subject to major changes, reorganizations, bugs and crashes!!!.
